# grr-gce

GRR is an incident response framework that allows responders to conduct remote forensics such as remote memory acquisition, artifact investigation, and binary uploads. GRR is managed by google [here](https://github.com/google/grr).

This alpha Terraform module represents the automatic creation of GRR infrastructure using GCP GCE, Container-Optimized OS, and Terraform.

TODO: all of this needs some updates since we do things differently

This module will:

* Create instance groups with global load balancers for each GRR component
* Generate certificates for the internal GRR PKI
* Set up GCE networking
* Set up CloudSQL
* Set up DNS records within your managed zone
* Hook in Identity Aware Proxy
* Generate new client installers and upload them to your GCS bucket

We also provide a docker-compose lab for local testing.

This project adheres to the [Open Code of Conduct](https://github.com/spotify/code-of-conduct). By participating, you are expected to honor this code.

# Prerequisites

* Google Cloud Platform credentials [configured](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/) for use with Terraform
* SSL certificate and private key in PEM format
* Google managed [DNS zone](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/)
* Configured [IAP Client](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/enabling-compute-howto)
* Docker
* OpenSSL

# Local testing

We provide a `docker-compose.yaml`, which orchestrates the creation of a local MySQL instance, GRR components, and appropriate bind mounts for placing newly generated client installers.

1. Run `docker-compose up`
1. Access the AdminUI at `http://localhost:8443`
1. Username and password is `root:root`

Client installers will be generated and placed in `test/installers`. Utility scripts are provided in `test/scripts` for:

* Local macOS client installation/uninstallation
* Testing certificate rotation

# Configuration

## User Management

This module utilizes Google's [Identity Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/enabling-compute-howto), which allows you to lock down access to an application by using Google identities. After your GRR cluster is created, you must grant the appropriate IAM permissions for each principle you would like to grant access to the UI.

## SSH Management
This module enables OSLogin, which allows you to manage SSH access and root privileges using Google identities and IAM. SSH to these instance is locked down by default. Consult the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access#configure_users) to learn how to manage access.

## Docker Image Creation
This module was tested with a snapshot of `grrdocker/grr:latest`, which was at version `v3.2.4.7`. The current dockerfiles use `latest` as a base, which is constantly being updated and may introduce breaking changes. We intend to pin this base image when `v3.2.4.7` is pinned on for the `grrdocker/grr` [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/grrdocker/grr/).

To create an image suitable for deployment:

1. Change the `image` keys in the `docker-compose.yaml` definition to the full qualified image name that you intend to roll out for deployment. This needs to be for a repository that your GCE instances have access to.
1. Run `docker-compose build`
1. Run `docker push <image>` for each of the newly built images
1. Update the `grr_<adminui|worker|frontend>_image` and `grr_<adminui|worker|frontend>_image_tag` terraform variables as necessary
1. Run a `terraform plan`, confirm correctness, and `terraform apply`
